	    Your minutes are gold, s'Market is here to hold!

	    On the B2B side, s'Market generates the optimal route for in-store product pickers to 
    gather all the products on the customer's shopping list. Through indoor store mapping and 
    optimization algorithms, s'Market improves pickers' work and delivers 100% yield even for 
    inexperienced pickers from day one.
	    On the B2C side, s'Market generates the optimal route to a single product in the store. In 
    addition, we provide customer satisfaction and valuable data about the routes customers use so that the 
    store can optimize product placement on the shelves.


---Architecture

---General aspects

	PROBLEM
	    ➤ inefficient picking
	    ➤ time & money wasted
	    ➤ limited staff resources
	SOLUTION
	    ➤ supermarket mapping
	    ➤ optimizing algorithms
	    ➤ client satisfaction

	    The picker scans each product in front of its shelf. We can make a decision based on the scanning 
    output. The system can print the following route once the product is successfully scanned by the 
    picker (from product 1 to product 2, then from product 2 to product 3, and so on). The "Got it" 
    button on the MVP represents the equivalent of the scan output.
